in this project, i cleaned the dataset with Excel. Also I created a dashboard with Excel using the under listed Parameters:

Average Income per Purchase,
Customer Age Brackect by Purchase,
Customer Commute Distace by Purchase.

 I also add slicers that can help one to navigate through region, marital status, education, home owner, and occupation of the customers for more insight in decision making.
After analysing the dataset and creating virtuals and dashboard, I discovered that middle age group makes purchase,those that commute within 0-1 mile makes the highest purchase. Also male makes more purchase than the female.
