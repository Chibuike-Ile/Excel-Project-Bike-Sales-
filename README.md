# Excel-Project-Bike-Sales-
A project on bike sales in Europe with visualization that shows average income per purchase, customer age bracket, and customer commute distance. I also add slicers that can help one to navigate through region, marital status, education, home owner, and occupation of the customers for more insight in decision making.
After analysing the dataset and creating virtuals and report, I discovered that middle age group makes purchase,those that commute within 0-1 mile makes the highest purchase. Also male makes more purchase than the female.
