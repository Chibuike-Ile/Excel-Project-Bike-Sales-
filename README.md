 In this project, I cleaned the dataset with Excel. I created a column for age brackets to enhance the analysis with these conditions.
  **'Old'- 55 & above**
  **'Middle Age'- 31 to 54**
  **'Adolesent'- 1 to 30**

# Also I created a dashboard with Excel using the under listed Parameters:
   Average Income per Purchase,
   Customer Age Brackect by Purchase,
   Customer Commute Distace by Purchase,
   Count of Purchased Bike by Region

I also add slicers that can help one to navigate through region, marital status, education, home owner, and occupation of the customers for more insight in decision making.

 # Findings:
   The Company have more market in middle age bracket. 
   Those that commute within 0-1 mile makes the highest purchase. 
   Also male makes more purchase than the female.
   North America has the highest count of purchased bike.

# Recommendation:
  Investigating why North America has the biggest number of purchases is necessary to determine whether it will be released in other regions.
  They should focus much on areas with people in the middle age bracket.
